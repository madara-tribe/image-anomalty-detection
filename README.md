# image_anomalty_detection

# steps

## 1. train by styleGAN

Train only normal images by stleGAN and generate images too similar to normal images

<b>generate process</b>


<b>generated images</b>



## 2.calculate anomaly score and plot these by various ways

<b>normal and anomaly image</b>


<b>Plot these anomaly score</b>


## 3.anomaly detection by faiss

<b>I acomplished about 99% accuracy to classify normal and anomaly images by stylaGAN model and similar image search tec(faiss)</b>





The logics are written by bellow my blog
